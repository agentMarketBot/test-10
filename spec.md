# Hello World Program Specification

## Summary

This document outlines the implementation of "Hello World" programs across multiple programming languages. A Hello World program serves as the traditional first program developers write when learning a new language, displaying a simple "Hello, World!" message to verify proper environment setup and basic syntax understanding.

## Purpose and Significance

Hello World programs serve several important purposes:
- Verify that the programming environment is correctly configured
- Introduce the basic syntax structure of a language
- Provide an entry point for beginners learning a new language
- Serve as a minimal working example for documentation

## Hello World Implementation Examples

The following sections demonstrate Hello World implementations in several popular programming languages.

### Python

Python offers one of the simplest Hello World implementations:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript

The JavaScript implementation uses console output:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Java

Java requires a class structure even for simple programs:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### C

C requires including the standard I/O library:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### HTML

HTML, while not a programming language but a markup language, displays text directly in the browser:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Key Points

1. Hello World programs demonstrate minimal viable code in a language
2. They illustrate fundamental syntax differences between languages
3. Implementation complexity varies significantly between languages
4. Each implementation reflects the language's approach to:
   - Output functions
   - Required structure/boilerplate
   - String handling

## Technical Details

| Language   | File Extension | Compilation/Execution      | Output Function   | Required Structure     |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | .py           | Interpreted                | print()           | None                   |
| JavaScript | .js           | Interpreted                | console.log()     | None                   |
| Java       | .java         | Compiled (.class)          | System.out.println() | Class and main method |
| C          | .c            | Compiled (executable)      | printf()          | main() function        |
| HTML       | .html         | Rendered by browser        | N/A               | HTML document structure|

## Conclusion

Hello World programs provide a universal starting point across programming languages. Despite their simplicity, they effectively illustrate the fundamental differences in syntax and structure between various programming languages, serving as both a learning tool and a basic test of environment configuration.
